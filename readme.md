## Lab8: Calculator and Guessing Game
# CalcFacApp.java


## Synopsis
`CalcFacApp.java` is a Java application that performs two main functions:
1. Calculates the factorial of a given non-negative integer. The user is prompted to enter a non-negative integer, and the application calculates and displays the factorial of the entered number. Negative integers are not accepted.

2. Implements a "Guess the Number" game where the user guesses a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. The application provides hints if the guess is too high or too low until the correct number is guessed. Negative integers are not accepted.
